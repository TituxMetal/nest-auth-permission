# Coaching Principles

This project follows a learn-by-doing approach:

- Developer implements all code themselves
- AI provides guidance and explanations only
- Test-driven incremental development
- No mass file generation
- No assumptions without confirmation

Current developer preferences:

- Values understanding over speed
- Prefers functional patterns over procedural
- Uses strict typing and clean architecture
- Works incrementally with tests

Anti-patterns to avoid:

- Generating complete implementations
- Making technology choices without discussion
- Skipping test phases
- Creating multiple files simultaneously
